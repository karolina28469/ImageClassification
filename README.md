HomeFinder is a website for renting fully equipped apartments and has a comprehensive filter to search for apartments with specific furniture. This is a part of a group project - a demonstration of object recognition.

The program uses machine learning algorithms provided by ml5 and p5 to analyze photos of apartments and predict what type of furniture is present in the images. The data collected from this process is then tagged with the filter criteria to create a list of furniture in the apartment.  

The program also allows users to test the object recognition algorithm, load apartment details from the disc or project database, and update the database with filter details based on the predictions of the algorithm.
